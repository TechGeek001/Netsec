Hello, I am Galen Erso. Director Krennic has hidden the Death Star plans are hidden somewhere in the network. I don't know where they are, but I want to help you retrieve them. I have hidden my MySQL password in an image of a Star Destroyer in my home directory on the Empire's file server using a program called "steghide"; the password is my daughter's name: "jyn". Hopefully there is information there that helps you. Here's what else I know:

- I don't know what IP address the Empire's share drive is on, but it uses the default SMB port
- All users access the share drive with a common set of credentials
- Kendal Ozzel keeps backup copies of important documents on the Empire's share drive
- I don't know what IP address the Empire's database server is on, but it uses the default MySQL port
- Orson Krennic has unrestricted access to the database. He can even upload arbitrary user-defined functions to it! He changes his password frequently and never uses the same password twice.

Oh, I also know that the Empire's network administrators have been complaining that some clients are mis-configured and are leaking sensitive information. Good luck!
