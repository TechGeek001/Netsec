Hello, I am Galen Erso. The Death Star plans are on the Empire's database server, but I don't have the credentials to access them. I have hidden my MySQL password in an image of a Star Destroyer in my home directory on the file server using a program called "steghide"; the password is my daughter's name: "jyn". Hopefully you can find information there that will help you get to the plans. Here is some other information that might help:

- I don't know where the Empire's share drive is, but it uses the default SMB port and is accessible to anyone without a password
- Kendal Ozzel keeps backup copies of important documents on the Empire's share drive
- I don't know where the Empire's database server is, but it uses the default MySQL port
- Orson Krennic has unrestricted access to the database. He can even upload arbitrary user-defined functions to it

Good luck!
