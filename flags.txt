- Admiral Ozzel was a fool. Not only did he jump out of hyperspace too close to Hoth, he also re-used passwords for important files. Incompetence!
- When the Empire migrated its database from Eadu to Scarif, it made significant security improvements. It almost seems like Galen Erso wanted the Empire's secrets to get stolen when he built the user table, storing the passwords in plain text.
- Tiaan Jerjerrod is the only person that the Empire trusts to execute arbitrary user-defined functions on the Empire's MySQL instance.
